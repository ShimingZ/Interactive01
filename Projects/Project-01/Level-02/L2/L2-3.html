	<strong>Be Music, Night<</strong>
	Be Music, Night<br>
	That her sleep may go Where angels have their pale tall choirs 
	<br>
	Be a hand, sea<br>
	That her dreams may watch Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world <br>

	<h1>Be Music, Night</h1>

	<font color="#98AFC7"> 
	Be a voice, sky,<br>
	And the stars will tilt their quiet faces Into the mirror of her loveliness<br>

	Be a road, earth,<br>
	That her walking may take thee Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires <br>

	O be a world and a throne, God,<br>
	That her living may find its weather And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book<br>
	Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house<br>
