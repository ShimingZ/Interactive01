		<br>Be music, night, <br>
				<br>That her sleep may go <br>
				<br>Where angels have their pale tall choirs <br>

		<br>Be a hand, sea, <br>
				<br>That her dreams may watch <br>
				<br>Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world <br>

		<br>Be a voice, sky, <br>
					<br>And the stars will tilt their quiet faces <br>
					<br>Into the mirror of her loveliness <br>

		<br>Be a road, earth, <br>
					<br>That her walking may take thee <br>
					<br>Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires <br>

		<br>O be a world and a throne, God, <br>
				<br>That her living may find its weather <br>
				<br>And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book <br>
				<br>Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house <br>	</p>
