				Be music, night, <br>
				That her sleep may go <br>

				That her dreams may watch <br>
				Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world <br>

					And the stars will tilt their quiet faces<br>
					Into the mirror of her loveliness<br>

		<h1>Be a road, earth,</h1>

					That her walking may take thee<br>
					Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires<br>

		<h1>O be a world and a throne, God,</h1>

				That her living may find its weather <br>
				And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book<br>
				Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house<br>	</p>
