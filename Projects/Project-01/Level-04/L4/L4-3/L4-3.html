	Be music, <em>night,</em> <br></h1>
	That her sleep may go <br>
	Where angels have their pale tall choirs <br>
	<br>
	Be a hand, <em>sea,</em> <br>
	That her dreams may watch <br>
	Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world <br>
	<br>
	Be a voice, <em>sky,</em> <br>
	And the stars will tilt their quiet faces <br>
	Into the mirror of her loveliness <br>
	<br>
	Be a road, <em>earth,</em> <br>
	That her walking may take thee  <br>
	Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires <br>
	<br>
	O be a world and a throne, <em>God,</em> <br>
	That her living may find its weather <br>
	And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book<br>
	Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house<br>
