				That her sleep may go <br>

		<h1>Be a hand, sea,</h1>
		<div class="right" id="line-through">
				That her dreams may watch <br>
				Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world <br>

		<h1>Be a voice, sky,</h1>
		<div class="right" id="line-through">
				And the stars will tilt their quiet faces <br>
				Into the mirror of her loveliness <br>
			</p>
			
		<h1>Be a road, earth, </h1>
		<div class="right" id="line-through">
				That her walking may take thee <br>
				Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires <br>
			</p>

		<h1>O be a world and a throne, God,</h1>
		<div class="right" id="line-through">
				That her living may find its weather <br>
				And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book <br>
				Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house <br>
