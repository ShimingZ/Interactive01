	<b>Be Music, night</b><br>
	Be music, night, <br>
	That her sleep may go <br>
	Where angels have their pale tall choirs <br>
	Be a hand, sea, <br>
	That her dreams may watch <br>
	Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world <br>
	Be a voice, sky, <br>
	And the stars will tilt their quiet faces <br>
	Into the mirror of her loveliness <br>
	Be a road, earth, <br>
	That her walking may take thee  <br>
	Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires <br>
	O be a world and a throne, God, <br>
	That her living may find its weather <br>
	And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book<br>
	Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house<br>
